# simple examples

```
    python3 tester.py
```

when ypu password is 'studentpass' then you should be able to see similar to this
```
    User S1 can log in: True
    User S2 can log in: False
    User P1 can log in: False
```

it is because only student with user_id S1 is meet the criteria user can log in. you could always add more tester and feel free to extend it yourself
